    Choosing an Appropriate Weight for Resistance Exercise: Help Guide</h2>
    </b>
<br>

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<br> <br><b>
** Safety is most important! Always check with your healthcare provider before starting an exercise regime. **</b>
<br><br><br>
When participating in resistance training exercises, it is important to ensure that you are lifting an appropriate weight. 
<br><br>You must take into consideration the size of the muscle group(s) that you will be working for each particular exercise: <br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For larger muscle groups (ex. glutes, quads, back, chest, hamstrings) = select a heavier starting weight<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For smaller muscle groups (ex. shoulders, biceps, triceps, calves) = select a lighter starting weight <br><br>
<br>
Good form reduces injury. Always select a weight that allows you to maintain good form for the entirety of the exercise.
<br><br>
Go slow, momentum is cheating.
    <br><br>

<br><br>
As a general starting point, for each exercise find the heaviest weight that you can complete 1x with good form. <br><b>This is your One Rep Max (1RM)</b>
<br><br><br>
To determine the amount of weight to use for the exercise, reduce your 1RM by the following percentage based on your workout goal:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build Muscle Mass = Reduce 1RM by 50%
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscular Strength = Reduce 1RM by 60%
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muscular Endurance = Reduce 1RM by 70%
<br><br>
<br>
    
If you find that you are able to complete 1-2 more reps than the recommended number in each set, increase weight by 2-10% until you reach fatigue within the set. <br><br><br>

<br><br>
As an example:<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say I am determining my 1 Rep Max for Bench Press. I find I can lift 100 pounds 1-time. This is my 1RM for Bench Press. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My resistance training goal is to improve muscular strength.<br><br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine how much weight I do for bench press, I reduce my 1RM by 60%: <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bench Press 1RM: 100lbs<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal: Muscular Strength (Reduce 1RM by 60%)<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weight to use for Bench Press exercises: 40 pounds<br><br><br>
