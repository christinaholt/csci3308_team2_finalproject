Searchable open-source database organized by either major muscle, minor muscle, equipment, exercise type, and has gifs showing what it should look like.
- Downloadable as a CSV! (completely free, no copyrights)
- 115 individual exercises

https://exrx.net/Lists/Directory
Also searchable organized by body part (arms, legs, etc.) and then muscle. Has descriptions with equipment listed. Uses both gifs and videos.
- No download versions (copyright restrictions, but fair for educational purposes (that's us)... in other words, as long as we don't sell it or pass it off as ours)

Same as those above, except this one only has drawings, no gifs or videos. Well-organized.
- This one has a github account to the code for the website itself! Openly welcomes others to contribute, download, adjust, and use.
- One place under the developer page shows a copyright, however, everywhere you will see many other people contributing and using the code itself. As long as we mention "Roland Geider" as the source creator, we will be fine.

https://github.com/davejt/exercise
An API of a list of common exercises and muscle groups. Free to use in any app. No copyright.
- not sure it would be useful. Looks like a program that simply finds the name of exercises when someone initiates a search
