Final Project for CSCI 3308 Spring 2019.

# Customized Workout Generator

## Team
Lauren Deans
Christina Holt
Bret Murray
Derek Sessions

## Vision Statement
We will provide a web application that will be a tool for guiding the bored workout enthusiast. The user will provide input parameters such length of workout, equipment to use, and body target area, which will be used to generate a custom workout that help them meet their workout goals for the day.

With plenty of room for expansion, we can add descriptions/pictures/video for exercise catalog, provide options for printing/emailing, and adding "memory" such that we can track users' goals, past workouts, and favorites.

## Motivation
We are all interested in using an excercise tool that we've come up with. The scope seems to be achievable in the time period alotted for this class. Also, Lauren has Excercise Science Degree. We have an expert on the team, and should use that to our advantage. 

## Risks

- First time the team has worked together. Gathering everyone on a regular basis could be difficult.
- Accessing database of excercise, or creating our own, could lead to difficulties. Brute force work if we create our own. We don't know what open-source information exists for exercise databases. 
- No experience with this type of web application project. 

## Mitigation strategies

- Devote more effort to checking in on various lines of communications. Regularly scheduled meetings. 
- Start with a small database as early as possible. Prioritize finding this information to address the problem as early as possible.
-  Study hard, practice, Google it. Learn together and communicate regularly. Ask questions on Piazza or StackOverflow.
