# csci3308_team2_finalproject
Final Project for CSCI 3308 Spring 2019.

# Customized Workout Generator

## Team
Lauren Deans, Christina Holt, Bret Murray, Derek Sessions

## Vision Statement
We will provide a web application that will be a tool for guiding the bored workout enthusiast. The user will provide input parameters such length of workout, equipment to use, and body target area, which will be used to generate a custom workout that help them meet their workout goals for the day.

With plenty of room for expansion, we can add descriptions/pictures/video for exercise catalog, provide options for printing/emailing, and adding "memory" such that we can track users' goals, past workouts, and favorites.

## Motivation
We are all interested in using an excercise tool similar to the one we've devised. The scope of the project seems to be achievable given our restraints: time, experience, and platform. Also, Lauren has an Excercise Science Degree. Since we share common interest, and have an expert on the team, we have decided to use that to our advantage. 

## Risks

- First time the team has worked together. Gathering everyone on a regular basis could be difficult.
- Deterimining the source of our excercise database. Creating our own could lead to difficulties. We could tackle the problem with brute force given enough time and prioritizing the monotonous data entry. We don't know what open-source information exists for exercise databases and how we may be able to levereage existing databases. 
- No experience with this type of web application project. 

## Mitigation strategies

- Devote more effort to checking in on various lines of communications. Regularly scheduled meetings. 
- Start with a small excercise database as early as possible. Prioritize finding this information to address the problem as early as possible.
-  Study hard, practice, Google it. Learn together and communicate regularly. Ask questions on Piazza or StackOverflow.

## Development Method

Apply Agile methods appropriate for our busy schedules. We plan to incorporate regular video meetings, and a Trello board for Kanban tracking. 

- Weekly tag-up to discuss our achievements for the week, and our upcoming tasks. An evening later in the week is ideal for the group since it goes along with our typical Monday "end of week" schedule. 
- Definining sprints two weeks at a time to coincide with Milestones.
- Individually, we check in and update Trello board frequently. Follow work through email notifications. 
- Communication channels through both Slack and email until things become more stable.

## Project Tracking Software
