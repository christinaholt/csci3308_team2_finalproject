## Vision Statement
We will provide a web application that will be a tool for guiding the bored workout enthusiast. The user will provide input parameters such length of workout, equipment to use, and body target area, which will be used to generate a custom workout that help them meet their workout goals for the day.

With plenty of room for expansion, we can add descriptions/pictures/video for exercise catalog, provide options for printing/emailing, and adding "memory" such that we can track users' goals, past workouts, and favorites.
